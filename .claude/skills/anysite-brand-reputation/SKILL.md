```

2. **Classify Mentions**

- Neutral: Question, general mention, factual

Category:
- Product feedback
- Customer service issue

```

3. **Prioritize Issues**
```
High Priority:

- Legal/safety concerns

Medium Priority:

### Workflow 2: Crisis Detection and Management

**Scenario**: Identify and track potential PR crises

**Steps**:

1. **Monitor for Anomalies**
```
Track baseline:

- Average sentiment score
- Typical engagement levels

Alert triggers:
- Mentions >2x baseline
- Negative sentiment >50%
- Viral negative content (high engagement)
```

2. **Deep Dive on Spikes**
```
When alert triggered:

search_twitter_posts(query="brand name", count=500)
→ Identify what's driving spike

search_reddit_posts(query="brand name", count=200)
→ Check community discussions

For viral posts:
  get_twitter_post(post_id) or get_reddit_post(url)
  → Analyze reach and engagement
  → Read comments for context
```

3. **Assess Crisis Severity**
```
Severity factors:
- Volume (how many mentions)
- Velocity (how fast growing)
- Reach (influencer involvement, media coverage)
- Sentiment (how negative)
- Validity (legitimate issue vs. misunderstanding)
```

4. **Track Crisis Evolution**
```
Hourly monitoring:
- Mention volume trend
- Sentiment shifts
- Platform spread
- Media pickup
- Official response impact
```

5. **Measure Resolution**
```
Track until:
- Volume returns to baseline
- Sentiment improves
- No new negative mentions for 24-48h
```

**Expected Output**:
- Crisis timeline
- Mention volume graph
- Sentiment tracking
- Key influencers/posts
- Response effectiveness

### Workflow 3: Competitive Reputation Benchmarking

**Scenario**: Compare brand sentiment vs. competitors

**Steps**:

1. **Define Competitors**
```
List 3-5 main competitors
```

2. **Gather Mentions for All**
```
For brand + each competitor:
  search_twitter_posts(query=brand, count=200)
  search_reddit_posts(query=brand, count=100)
  search_linkedin_posts(keywords=brand, count=50)
```

3. **Calculate Brand Health Scores**
```
For each brand:

Mention Volume: Total mentions
Sentiment Score: (Positive - Negative) / Total
Engagement Rate: Avg engagement per mention
Share of Voice: Your mentions / Total category mentions
```

4. **Analyze Strengths/Weaknesses**
```
Compare:
- What are competitors praised for?
- What are competitors criticized for?
- Where do we excel?
- Where do we fall short?
```

5. **Identify Opportunities**
```
Look for:
- Unmet customer needs (complaints about competitors)
- Messaging gaps (what they're not saying)
- Product differentiation opportunities
- Customer service advantages
```

**Expected Output**:
- Competitive sentiment matrix
- Brand health scores comparison
- Strength/weakness analysis
- Strategic opportunities
